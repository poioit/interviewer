# Tree Uniqueness, Serialize, Deserialize

* General binary tree
    * Record **preorder + inorde traversal** to reconstruct unique tree.
    * Record **preorder + leaf node** also works.
    * Record **level order + leaf node** also works.
* BST, binary search tree
    * We only need to record **preorder traversal**, because inorder traversal can be found when we sort all node's value.
    * Record **preorder + leaf node** also works.
    * Record **level order + leaf node** also works.
* Replace preorder traversal with postorder traversal also works.
* Level order traversalï¼ˆleetcode's way to serialize a tree) https://leetcode.com/faq/#binary-tree
